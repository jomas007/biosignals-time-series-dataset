"HI, IT'S LINDA RAYNIER OF LINDARAYNIER.COM",0.0,2.58,tt4TF1wqz9U
"CAREER STRATEGIST, SPEAKER AND COACH.",2.58,2.38,tt4TF1wqz9U
AND IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU EXACTLY HOW TO ANSWER THE,5.1,4.16,tt4TF1wqz9U
"""WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF 5 YEARS FROM NOW?"" INTERVIEW QUESTION",9.26,2.54,tt4TF1wqz9U
IN A WAY THAT GETS YOU CLOSER TO LANDING THE JOB OFFER WITHOUT PUTTING OFF THE INTERVIEWER.,11.8,5.12,tt4TF1wqz9U
AND HERE'S A HINT.,17.02,1.2,tt4TF1wqz9U
THE ANSWER DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO BE A MANAGER OR DIRECTOR IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS.,18.22,5.26,tt4TF1wqz9U
"SO IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH THIS INTERVIEW QUESTION THEN PAY ATTENTION,",23.48,3.22,tt4TF1wqz9U
BECAUSE I HAVE A SECRET FORMULA,26.72,2.24,tt4TF1wqz9U
THAT I THINK WORKS ACROSS ANY JOB TITLE AND ANY INDUSTRY.,28.96,4.62,tt4TF1wqz9U
"NOW BEFORE WE ANSWER THIS QUESTION,",33.58,1.58,tt4TF1wqz9U
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE EMPLOYER IS ASKING US THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.,35.16,4.38,tt4TF1wqz9U
"AS REALISTIC OR UNREALISTIC AS THAT MAY SEEM,",44.06,3.42,tt4TF1wqz9U
"IF YOU GIVE ANY HINTS THAT YOU PLAN TO BE ELSEWHERE,",47.48,4.66,tt4TF1wqz9U
"AND NOT WORK AT THIS COMPANY FROM NOW WELL INTO THE FUTURE,",52.14,3.44,tt4TF1wqz9U
THEN THEY'LL CONSIDER THAT AS A RED FLAG AND LIKELY NOT CONSIDER YOU FURTHER IN THE PROCESS.,55.58,4.38,tt4TF1wqz9U
"SO IF YOU ACTUALLY TRULY PLAN TO RUN A BUSINESS IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS,",60.36,4.32,tt4TF1wqz9U
MAYBE A GOOD IDEA TO NOT MENTION THAT AS PART OF YOUR ANSWER.,64.68,3.4,tt4TF1wqz9U
YOU WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOUR ANSWER SPEAKS TO THIS JOB AND ONLY TO WHAT THIS JOB HAS TO OFFER.,78.78,6.0,tt4TF1wqz9U
"SOMETIMES COMPANIES DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL ROLE FOR YOU TO GO INTO IN THE NEXT 2, 3, 5 YEARS.",84.78,6.96,tt4TF1wqz9U
"SO IF YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S YOUR EXPECTATION TO BE PROMOTED INTO A MANAGER TITLE,",91.74,5.18,tt4TF1wqz9U
"MANAGER ROLE OR DIRECTOR ROLE IN THE NEXT X NUMBER OF YEARS,",96.94,3.92,tt4TF1wqz9U
"THEN THEY'LL LIKELY ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND NOT CONSIDER YOU FURTHER,",100.86,4.52,tt4TF1wqz9U
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WHAT YOU WANT.,105.38,2.18,tt4TF1wqz9U
OR THEY'LL SEE YOU AS OVERLY AMBITIOUS AND USING THIS OPPORTUNITY AS A STEPPING STONE,107.62,6.5,tt4TF1wqz9U
TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL.,114.12,1.6,tt4TF1wqz9U
"OKAY SO NOW WE UNDERSTAND WHY THIS QUESTION IS ASKED,",115.72,3.36,tt4TF1wqz9U
I'LL NOW GIVE YOU MY MAGIC FORMULA FOR HOW THIS QUESTION SHOULD BE ANSWERED.,119.08,4.42,tt4TF1wqz9U
THERE ARE 2 PARTS TO THIS ANSWER,123.64,2.08,tt4TF1wqz9U
"AND IN THIS EXAMPLE, I'VE USED AN ACCOUNTING TYPE OF EXAMPLE.",125.72,3.94,tt4TF1wqz9U
BUT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE AS WE GO ALONG.,129.66,2.58,tt4TF1wqz9U
"SO, PART 1 OF THE ANSWER IS:",132.24,2.56,tt4TF1wqz9U
SO THAT IS PART 1.,157.24,1.54,tt4TF1wqz9U
PART 2 IS:,158.9,1.44,tt4TF1wqz9U
"THE REASON WHY THIS FORMULA WORKS SO WELL IS BECAUSE FIRSTLY, YOU'RE KEEPING IT GENERAL.",180.22,3.86,tt4TF1wqz9U
"YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC TITLES YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE,",184.1,4.16,tt4TF1wqz9U
WHICH MAY PUT OFF SOME  INTERVIEWERS.,188.26,2.44,tt4TF1wqz9U
"AND INSTEAD, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ""WHAT YOU'LL DO"" INSTEAD OF ""WHO YOU'LL BE"" IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS.",190.74,6.48,tt4TF1wqz9U
"AND SECONDLY, YOU SHOW THAT YOU'RE EAGER AND THAT YOU TRULY WANT THIS JOB.",197.22,4.04,tt4TF1wqz9U
"THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON THIS ROLE, AND THIS ROLE ONLY.",201.26,3.18,tt4TF1wqz9U
THAT YOU SIMPLY WANT TO HELP AND GIVE VALUE.,204.44,2.78,tt4TF1wqz9U
SO IF YOU'VE BEEN SAYING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS,207.62,2.72,tt4TF1wqz9U
"AND YOU LIKE THIS LITTLE 2-PART FORMULA THAT I'VE COME UP WITH TO ANSWER THE,",210.34,3.48,tt4TF1wqz9U
"""WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF 5 YEARS FROM NOW?"" INTERVIEW QUESTION,",213.82,2.82,tt4TF1wqz9U
"THEN FEEL FREE TO USE IT, AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES.",216.64,3.12,tt4TF1wqz9U
"SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THIS INTERVIEW QUESTION,",220.2,1.98,tt4TF1wqz9U

MOUTHS YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE VALUE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE,134.84,4.38,DSaj9qMwvLI
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT IS BEYOND WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE,139.22,4.29,DSaj9qMwvLI
JUST TALKING ABOUT AT A SURFACE LEVEL LISTENING INTENTLY DOESN'T JUST MEAN,143.51,3.78,DSaj9qMwvLI

COMMUNICATOR STEP NUMBER TWO RESPOND WITH PHRASES THAT RELATE TO WHAT THAT,194.3,5.1,DSaj9qMwvLI
PERSON IS TALKING ABOUT YOU CAN START OFF WITH PHRASES SUCH AS THAT'S,199.4,5.16,DSaj9qMwvLI
INTERESTING BECAUSE I CAN RELATE BECAUSE THAT'S TRUE,204.56,5.01,DSaj9qMwvLI
BECAUSE STARTING YOUR CONVERSATION WITH THESE TYPES OF WORDS SHOWS THAT YOU'RE,209.57,5.73,DSaj9qMwvLI
INTERESTED AND ENGAGED IN THE OTHER PERSON AND SO IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE,215.3,4.2,DSaj9qMwvLI
ENGAGED AND INTERESTED IN YOU WHEN YOU'RE COMMUNICATING WITH THEM YOU FIRST,219.5,4.17,DSaj9qMwvLI
HAVE TO GIVE THAT ENERGY SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE ETC ETC ETC,223.67,5.75,DSaj9qMwvLI
SHOWS THAT YOU CAN RELATE AND YOU CAN VALIDATE WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS SAYING,229.42,4.93,DSaj9qMwvLI
AND THAT IS WHAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE'RE ALL LOOKING TO DO TO BE VALIDATED TO BE,234.35,5.85,DSaj9qMwvLI
HEARD BY OTHER PEOPLE AND TO FEEL CONNECTED TO THOSE THAT WE'RE TALKING TO,240.2,4.08,DSaj9qMwvLI
STEP NUMBER THREE TO IMPROVING YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS TELL STORIES AFTER,244.28,4.62,DSaj9qMwvLI
THE BECAUSE PART OF YOUR CONVERSATION TELL A STORY THAT RELATES TO WHAT THAT,248.9,5.7,DSaj9qMwvLI
PERSON IS TALKING ABOUT THE STORY OBVIOUSLY HAS TO HAVE A POINT AND IT HAS,254.6,4.35,DSaj9qMwvLI
TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS IN RELATION TO WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DISCUSSING AS I ALWAYS,258.95,4.32,DSaj9qMwvLI
SAY A GOOD STORY FOLLOWS THE SAME PATTERN AS A MOVIE THINK OF ANY GOOD,263.27,4.2,DSaj9qMwvLI
MOVIE YOU'VE WATCHED AND WHEN YOU CAN BREAK IT DOWN THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE,267.47,4.47,DSaj9qMwvLI
KEY PARTS TO THE MOVIE AND I CALL THIS SAR AN ACRONYM THAT STANDS FOR SITUATION,271.94,6.03,DSaj9qMwvLI
ACTION AND RESULTS THE MAJORITY OF THE MOVIE IS MADE UP OF THIS SITUATION THE,277.97,6.09,DSaj9qMwvLI
SETTING UP OF THE STORY GETTING TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS THEIR STORIES THEIR,284.06,4.77,DSaj9qMwvLI
SITUATIONS THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE,288.83,3.21,DSaj9qMwvLI
HAVING TO GO THROUGH AND THE SITUATION THE SETTING THAT THEY'RE IN THE SECOND,292.04,4.5,DSaj9qMwvLI
PART OF THE MOVIE IS THE ACTION WHERE THE GOOD GUY FIGHTS THE BAD GUY SO,296.54,4.17,DSaj9qMwvLI
YOU'RE ACTUALLY SEEING WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT THAT GUY IS,300.71,3.45,DSaj9qMwvLI
TAKING OR THAT GIRL IS TAKING TO RESOLVE THE INITIAL SITUATION OR THE PROBLEM,304.16,5.1,DSaj9qMwvLI
THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND THE THIRD PART OF THE MOVIE IS THE SHORTEST IN,309.26,3.12,DSaj9qMwvLI
LENGTH AND IT'S SIMPLY THE CONCLUSION OR THE RESULT WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WHEN,312.38,5.07,DSaj9qMwvLI
YOU CAN LEARN TO TELL YOUR STORIES USING THIS TYPE OF STRUCTURE IT'S GOING TO,317.45,3.93,DSaj9qMwvLI
MAKE THE OTHER PERSON FEEL MORE ENGAGED MORE INTERESTED IN YOU AND IN YOUR STORY,321.38,4.62,DSaj9qMwvLI
AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU TO PROVE THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE AS WELL,326.0,3.84,DSaj9qMwvLI
AND FINALLY STEP NUMBER FOUR TO IMPROVING YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS,329.84,2.96,DSaj9qMwvLI
PRACTICE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SO MANY PROFESSIONALS SEEM TO OVERLOOK WHEN,332.8,5.26,DSaj9qMwvLI
THEY'RE GOING TO ANY NETWORKING EVENT OR MEETING PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND,338.06,4.26,DSaj9qMwvLI
THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MEET THESE PEOPLE AND TALK TO THESE,342.32,3.0,DSaj9qMwvLI
PEOPLE AND THAT IS TO PRACTICE PRACTICE AHEAD OF TIME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY,345.32,5.28,DSaj9qMwvLI
IF YOU HAD AN IMPORTANT PRESENTATION TO DO AT WORK YOU WOULDN'T JUST WALK INTO,350.6,3.87,DSaj9qMwvLI
THE MEETING AND JUST BE UNPREPARED AND TALK ON THE FLY YOU WOULD WANT TO,354.47,4.68,DSaj9qMwvLI
PRACTICE AHEAD OF TIME WELL IN OTHER PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIAL SETTINGS IT ALSO,359.15,4.05,DSaj9qMwvLI
DOESN'T HURT TO PRACTICE AHEAD OF TIME YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR STORIES AHEAD OF,363.2,4.74,DSaj9qMwvLI
TIME PREPARED SO THAT WHEN YOU DO GO AHEAD AND COMMUNICATE THEM THEY'RE MORE,367.94,4.05,DSaj9qMwvLI
FLUENT THEY'RE MORE FLUID AND THEY COME OFF MORE NATURALLY WITHOUT THINKING,371.99,4.65,DSaj9qMwvLI
THROUGH AND DEVELOPING YOUR STORIES YOU WON'T SUCCEED IN YOUR COMMUNICATION SO,376.64,4.56,DSaj9qMwvLI
WORK ON YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS BY PRACTICING ON YOUR OWN TIME AND THEN THE,381.2,4.17,DSaj9qMwvLI
NEXT TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO GO INTO A GROUP MEETING OR GROUP CONVERSATION OR,385.37,4.29,DSaj9qMwvLI
JUST A ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN A MORE NATURAL,389.66,4.59,DSaj9qMwvLI

FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE,57.449,3.721,utwNhk3nmVU
I TAUGHT STUDENTS FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS,59.01,5.969,utwNhk3nmVU
FROM BEGINNER AND ADVANCED LEVELS I ALSO,61.17,6.3,utwNhk3nmVU
EXPERIENCE TEACHING KIDS IN A GROUP SET,64.979,4.591,utwNhk3nmVU
UP AND HAD SOME TRAINING ON HOW TO,67.47,6.75,utwNhk3nmVU
HANDLE CLASSES FOR KIDS AND ADULTS TILE,69.57,7.02,utwNhk3nmVU
IS ALSO CUSTOMIZED ACCORDING TO THE,74.22,5.789,utwNhk3nmVU
LEVEL AND GOAL OF THE STUDENTS BUT ONE,76.59,5.88,utwNhk3nmVU
THING IS CONSTANT I ALWAYS GIVE MY,80.009,5.491,utwNhk3nmVU
HUNDRED PERCENT IN EACH CLASS I ALWAYS,82.47,5.13,utwNhk3nmVU
MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS WILL FEEL,85.5,5.07,utwNhk3nmVU
RELAXED AND COMFORTABLE IN MY CLASS AND,87.6,5.97,utwNhk3nmVU
I FIND WAYS HOW TO BE CREATIVE ALL THE,90.57,7.13,utwNhk3nmVU
TIME AND NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT MY HOBBIES,93.57,7.159,utwNhk3nmVU
WELL IN FACT I DO HAVE A LOT OF HOBBIES,97.7,6.66,utwNhk3nmVU
THAT INCLUDE WATCHING MOVIES TV SERIES,100.729,7.241,utwNhk3nmVU
JAPANESE ANIMATION I ALSO LIKE STUDYING,104.36,6.88,utwNhk3nmVU

ANIMALS A LOT ACTUALLY I HAVE A DOGS AT,118.74,6.18,utwNhk3nmVU
HOME AND I REALLY CONSIDER THEM AS MY,122.399,6.75,utwNhk3nmVU
FAMILY MY PASSION IS RELATED TO ART SO I,124.92,7.77,utwNhk3nmVU
LIKE PHOTOGRAPHY AND FASHION SO I GUESS,129.149,4.261,utwNhk3nmVU
THAT'S,132.69,4.94,utwNhk3nmVU
ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT MYSELF BY,133.41,4.22,utwNhk3nmVU
IT ALWAYS STRIKES ME HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEIR PRESENTATIONS OR HOW THEY,5.69,5.619,LrjlW00kkws
PREPARE THEIR PRESENTATIONS. I'M ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST WORDS,11.309,4.681,LrjlW00kkws
THE FIRST SENTENCES OF A PRESENTATION.,15.99,1.527,LrjlW00kkws
WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO IS  THEY THINK OF A PRESENTATION,17.517,2.073,LrjlW00kkws
SO AUTOMATICALLY YOU THINK ABOUT A POWERPOINT SO YOU MAKE YOUR SLIDES,19.59,4.439,LrjlW00kkws
YOU LOOK AT YOUR SLIDES AND YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL I SAY SHOWING EACH SLIDE,24.029,4.981,LrjlW00kkws
BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS: WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST WORDS?,29.01,5.85,LrjlW00kkws
WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST SENTENCES? VERY FEW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT JUST THINK A MINUTE,34.86,3.99,LrjlW00kkws
ABOUT THE PRESENTATIONS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN THE PAST,38.85,3.389,LrjlW00kkws
MAYBE THEPRESENTATIONS THAT YOU HAVE DONE YOURSELF,42.239,2.963,LrjlW00kkws
THERE IS A CLICHE SENTENCE THAT,45.202,1.837,LrjlW00kkws
MOST SPEAKERS USE TO INTRODUCE THEIR TOPIC. THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE,47.039,4.981,LrjlW00kkws
"GOOD MORNING,  GOOD AFTERNOON, MY NAME IS ... (IF THEY DON'T KNOW YOU)",52.02,3.48,LrjlW00kkws
AND THEN THERE IS THIS TYPICAL SENTENCE,55.5,1.8,LrjlW00kkws
"""TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT...""",57.3,3.5,LrjlW00kkws
"NOW YOU MIGHT SAY ""SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?""",60.8,2.38,LrjlW00kkws
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS SENTENCE IS THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY,63.18,2.07,LrjlW00kkws
ANSWERING THE WRONG QUESTION YOU'RE ANSWERING THE WHAT QUESTION.,65.25,3.45,LrjlW00kkws
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?,68.7,1.23,LrjlW00kkws
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT....  IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT MOST AUDIENCES KNOW,69.93,5.64,LrjlW00kkws
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EITHER YOU ARE INTRODUCED OR THERE IS A PROGRAM,75.57,4.38,LrjlW00kkws
OR THERE IS A MEETING SO THERE IS AN AGENDA SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT YOUR TOPIC IS ALL ABOUT,79.95,4.95,LrjlW00kkws
THE MOST INTERESTING QUESTION TO ANSWER IS THE WHY QUESTION,84.9,5.46,LrjlW00kkws
WHY ARE YOU THERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY IS IT IMPORTANT,90.36,4.829,LrjlW00kkws
FOR THE AUDIENCE TO LISTEN TO YOU SO MY ADVICE FOR YOU IS TO FOCUS ON THE WHY QUESTION,95.189,6.011,LrjlW00kkws
NOW HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?  I ADVISE PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON A STORY TO,101.2,4.699,LrjlW00kkws
"BEGIN THEIR PRESENTATION. NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT STORIES, STORIES BEGIN WITH A TIME FRAME",105.899,5.101,LrjlW00kkws
JUST LOOK AT FAIRYTALES.  THEY START WITH ONCE UPON A TIME ...,111.0,5.1,LrjlW00kkws
IM' NOT GOING TO SUGGEST THAT YOU START YOUR PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION WITH ONCE UPON,116.1,3.36,LrjlW00kkws
A TIME ... BUT YOU CAN START WITH A TIME FRAME. SOMETHING LIKE: YESTERDAY,119.46,4.83,LrjlW00kkws
"TWO WEEKS AGO, LAST YEAR, THREE MONTHS AGO ... NOW WHAT'S THE KIND OF STORY THAT YOU CAN",124.29,4.919,LrjlW00kkws
SHARE THEN? USE REAL STORIES.  IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED,129.209,4.141,LrjlW00kkws
TO YOU. IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU HEARD. SO YOU CAN REFER TO A CONVERSATION,133.35,5.25,LrjlW00kkws
YOU HAD WITH A COLLEAGUE. YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING LIKE: YESTERDAY I HAD A,138.6,4.05,LrjlW00kkws
CONVERSATION WITH ... BUT THEN THERE HAS TO BE A REASON WHY YOU REFER TO THAT,142.65,4.53,LrjlW00kkws
CONVERSATION.  AND THERE IS THIS LINKING SENTENCE THAT I USE IN LOTS OF,147.18,4.53,LrjlW00kkws
PRESENTATIONS I TELL MY STORY AND THEN I CONTINUE SAYING: NOW WHY DO I TELL YOU THIS?,151.71,4.77,LrjlW00kkws
BECAUSE MY OBJECTIVE OR MY GOAL WITH THIS PRESENTATION IS TO ...,156.48,5.52,LrjlW00kkws
SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE COMPANY'S STORIES I MIGHT SAY,162.0,5.31,LrjlW00kkws
"IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WITH A CUSTOMER, IT CAN BE AN ARTICLE YOU READ,",167.31,4.26,LrjlW00kkws
"IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT,  IT CAN BE A CONVERSATION YOU HAD ...",171.57,4.43,LrjlW00kkws
"SO USE THESE STORIES TO BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATIONS, LINK THEM TO YOUR GOAL AND IT WILL BE SO",176.0,7.0,LrjlW00kkws
MUCH MORE INTERESTING FOR YOUR AUDIENCE BECAUSE IT WILL BE CRYSTAL CLEAR FOR THEM,183.0,3.5,LrjlW00kkws
FROM THE VERY FIRST MINUTE WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM.,186.5,4.5,LrjlW00kkws
SO NEXT TIME YOU PREPARE YOUR PRESENTATION  FOCUS ON THAT WHY QUESTION AND TELL THEM A STORY,191.0,6.84,LrjlW00kkws
